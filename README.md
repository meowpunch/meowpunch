I am passionate about contributing to new innovations of paradigms in everyday lives through technology 🤩

Nowadays, I've been interested in
- design patterns and principles (OOP)
- functional programming (scala)
- cloud native technologies (kubernetes, AWS)
- architectural patterns (microservices, event driven, hexagonal)
- data engineering (kafka, spark, airflow)
- recommendation system (spark ML, deep learning)
