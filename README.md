meow ðŸ‘‹

I have a passion and aspiration to contribute to creating new paradigms and values of life with technology ðŸ¤©

I love to explore technologies across multiple perspectives. Nowadays, I am interested in:
- JVM languages (java 17, scala, graalvm)
- programming paradigms (functional, declarative, imperative)
- design principles and patterns (in OOP)
- cloud native technologies (kubernetes, AWS)
- architectural patterns (microservices, event driven, hexagonal)
- data engineering (kafka, spark, airflow)
- recommendation system (spark ML, deep learning)
